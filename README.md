# AQT Aura ✨

**Reclaim your digital space.**

A minimalist browser extension built with WXT, React, and TypeScript. AQT Aura acts as a subtle layer over the web, filtering out noise and clutter to help you focus. While currently optimized for YouTube, the goal is to expand support to more websites, adding features to reduce distraction and improve quality of life across the web.

## Current Features (YouTube)
- **Distraction-Free**: Toggle headers, sidebars, and comments.
- **Feed Control**: Clean up Home and Subscriptions.
- **UI Tweaks**: Lowercase titles, hidden metadata, blurred thumbnails.

## Roadmap
- Support for additional websites with distraction-free modes.
- UI refinements and QoL tweaks.

## Credits
Based on and inspired by logic from **TubeMod**.

## Development
