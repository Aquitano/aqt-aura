# AQT Browser

A minimalist browser extension built with WXT, React, and TypeScript. While currently focused on YouTube, the goal is to expand support to more websites, adding features to reduce clutter, distraction, and improve quality of life across the web.

## Current Features (YouTube)
- **Distraction-Free**: Toggle headers, sidebars, and comments.
- **Feed Control**: Clean up Home and Subscriptions.
- **UI Tweaks**: Lowercase titles, hidden metadata, blurred thumbnails.

## Roadmap
- Support for additional websites with distraction-free modes.
- UI refinements and QoL tweaks.

## Credits
Based on and inspired by logic from **TubeMod**.

## Development
```bash
bun install
bun run dev
bun run build
```
